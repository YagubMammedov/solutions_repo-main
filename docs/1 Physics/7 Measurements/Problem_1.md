# Problem 1

Thank you for sharing your task images. Based on the instructions and formulas shown in the pendulum experiment, here's a structured English summary with the appropriate formulas you’ll need to complete your work:

### 🧪 **Experiment Title**:

**Measuring Earth’s Gravitational Acceleration Using a Pendulum**

---

### 🎯 **Objective**:

To measure the acceleration due to gravity, $g$, using a simple pendulum and to analyze the uncertainties in the measurements.

---

### 🔧 **Materials Needed**:

* A string (1 or 1.5 meters)
* A small weight (e.g., bag of coins)
* Stopwatch or smartphone timer
* Ruler or measuring tape

---

### 🛠️ **Procedure Overview**:

1. **Set up the pendulum**:

   * Attach the weight to one end of the string and fix the other end to a stable support.
   * Measure the pendulum length, $L$, from the suspension point to the center of mass of the weight.
   * Calculate length uncertainty:

     $$
     \Delta L = \frac{\text{Ruler Resolution}}{2}
     $$

2. **Collect data**:

   * Displace the pendulum slightly (under 15°) and release it.
   * Measure the time for 10 full oscillations ($T_{10}$) and repeat this 10 times.
   * Calculate the **mean time** for 10 oscillations:

     $$
     \overline{T_{10}} = \frac{1}{10} \sum T_{10}
     $$
   * Calculate the **standard deviation**, $\sigma_T$, of the 10 trials.
   * Calculate **uncertainty in mean time**:

     $$
     \Delta T_{10} = \frac{\sigma_T}{\sqrt{n}} \quad \text{where } n = 10
     $$

---

### 📐 **Calculations**:

1. **Calculate the Period $T$**:

   $$
   T = \frac{\overline{T_{10}}}{10} \quad ; \quad \Delta T = \frac{\Delta T_{10}}{10}
   $$

2. **Calculate the gravitational acceleration $g$**:

   $$
   g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}
   $$

3. **Propagate the uncertainty $\Delta g$**:

   $$
   \Delta g = g \sqrt{\left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2}
   $$

---

### 🔍 **Analysis**:

* Compare your measured value of $g$ with the standard value: **9.81 m/s²**.
* Discuss:

  * How ruler resolution affected $\Delta L$.
  * How timing variability affected $\Delta T$.
  * Possible experimental errors or assumptions (e.g., small angle approximation).

### 🧾 **Graph Explanation**:

The graph shows the **measured time for 10 oscillations** over 10 trials.

* **Blue dots and line**: The actual time measurements recorded in each trial.
* **Red dashed line**: The **mean value** of the time measurements.
* **Shaded red area**: The **±1 standard deviation** range, showing the spread (variation) of the data.
