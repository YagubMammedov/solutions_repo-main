Sure! Here's the English version of the mathematical derivations and theoretical foundations for your projectile motion analysis:

---

## 📘 1. Theoretical Foundation: Deriving the Equations of Motion

Projectile motion can be broken down into two components: **horizontal** (x) and **vertical** (y) motion. We'll assume **no air resistance** and that the projectile is launched from flat ground.

### 🔹 Horizontal Motion (x-direction):
There is no acceleration (constant velocity):
\[
x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
\]

### 🔹 Vertical Motion (y-direction):
There is constant downward acceleration due to gravity:
\[
y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

Where:
- \( v_0 \) = initial speed
- \( \theta \) = launch angle (in radians or degrees)
- \( g \approx 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) = gravitational acceleration
- \( t \) = time

---

## 📏 2. Time of Flight and Range

### 🕒 Time of Flight (T):
The time it takes for the projectile to hit the ground again:
\[
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

### 📍 Horizontal Range (R):
The total horizontal distance covered:
\[
R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot T = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

This tells us that **range depends on**:
- Launch angle \( \theta \)
- Initial velocity \( v_0 \)
- Gravity \( g \)

---

## 🔁 Family of Solutions (Parameter Effects)

- **Angle**: The range is maximum at \( \theta = 45^\circ \) because \( \sin(2\theta) \) reaches its peak at \( 90^\circ \).
- **Velocity**: Range increases **quadratically** with \( v_0 \).
- **Gravity**: Stronger gravity reduces the range.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Applications

- Used to model the motion of a **football**, **cannonball**, **rocket**, or even **water jets**.
- If the **launch height is not zero** (\( y_0 \neq 0 \)), the equations must be adjusted accordingly.
- With **air resistance**, the equations become differential equations that often require numerical solutions.

---

## ✅ Summary

- We've derived all core equations of projectile motion.
- The range depends heavily on the angle — it peaks at 45°.
- These simple equations form the basis of many simulations and real-world physics engines.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Add **launch height**
- Include **air resistance**
- Let you input custom values for velocity, gravity, etc.
- Plot **multiple curves** to compare parameter effects

Here's a starting point for your project on projectile motion. The code:

Derives and plots the horizontal range as a function of the launch angle (from 0° to 90°).

Simulates the projectile trajectory for a specific angle (e.g., 45°).

Uses ideal conditions: no air resistance, flat ground, constant gravity.

Next steps could include:

Varying initial velocity and observing the effect.

Adding air resistance (e.g., using a drag coefficient).

Simulating on uneven terrain or with wind.
