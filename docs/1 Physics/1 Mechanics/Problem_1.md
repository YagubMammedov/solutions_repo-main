## üìò Theoretical Foundation: Equations of Motion

We analyze a projectile launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \) above the horizontal. We assume:
- No air resistance,
- The projectile is launched from and lands at the same vertical level,
- The only acceleration is due to gravity \( g \).

---

### üß≠ Resolving Initial Velocity:

The initial velocity has two components:

- **Horizontal (x-direction)**:
  $$
  v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(\theta)
  $$

- **Vertical (y-direction)**:
  $$
  v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta)
  $$

---

### üîπ Horizontal Motion:

No acceleration in the horizontal direction (uniform motion):

- Position over time:
  $$
  x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
  $$

- Velocity:
  $$
  v_x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) = \text{constant}
  $$

---

### üî∏ Vertical Motion:

There is constant downward acceleration due to gravity:

- Position over time:
  $$
  y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  $$

- Velocity over time:
  $$
  v_y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) - g t
  $$

- Acceleration:
  $$
  a_y = -g
  $$

---

### üïí Time of Flight:

To find the total time the projectile is in the air, we solve \( y(T) = 0 \):

\[
0 = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot T - \frac{1}{2} g T^2
\]

Factoring out \( T \neq 0 \):

\[
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

---

### üìè Horizontal Range:

Range is the total horizontal distance traveled during time \( T \):

\[
R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot T
\]

Substitute \( T \):

\[
R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \right)
\]

Simplify:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

---

### ‚è´ Maximum Height:

The projectile reaches maximum height when vertical velocity is zero:
\[
v_y = 0 = v_0 \sin(\theta) - g t
\Rightarrow t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
\]

Now, plug into the vertical position equation:
\[
H_{\text{max}} = y(t_{\text{max}}) = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot \frac{v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} - \frac{1}{2} g \left( \frac{v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \right)^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
H_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
\]

Here's a starting point for your project on projectile motion. The code:

Derives and plots the horizontal range as a function of the launch angle (from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞).

Simulates the projectile trajectory for a specific angle (e.g., 45¬∞).

Uses ideal conditions: no air resistance, flat ground, constant gravity.

Next steps could include:

Varying initial velocity and observing the effect.

Adding air resistance (e.g., using a drag coefficient).

Simulating on uneven terrain or with wind.
